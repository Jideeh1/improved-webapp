This project is an extension of the [Flutter Project](https://github.com/Tatine-Fraxter23/Flutter) strictly for professors only.

This in-development application is an attempt of innovation to restructure ICCT's traditional attendance tracking system. By leveraging technology, our goal is to replace the traditional ways of recording attendance by hand with a more efficient and reliable approach. The development of this application reduces the susceptibility to errors, and boosts the accuracy and consistency of recording attendance. With added features for ICCT to leverage, we have added a scheduler in this application's calendar system, along with report cards and its document generation.
